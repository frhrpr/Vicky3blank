## 0) Scope and posture
This is a detailed reference for Japan’s internal order in our canon **Early Industrial Japan, Atlantic Stall** (POD 1688–1730). It describes the constitutional arrangement, institutions, social balance, and policy defaults circa **1836**. For the wider world setup, see `/docs/canon.md`. For in‑game law IDs and territorial posture, see `/docs/jap_laws_territory.md`.

## 1) Sovereignty and the executive

- **Head of State (de jure): The Emperor** — sacral and ceremonial authority; invests the Shogun; presides over court rites; limited direct policy role.
- **Head of Government (de facto executive): The Shogun** — chairs the **Rōjū Council**; commands the army and Coastal Steam Guard; appoints high officials; promulgates edicts.
- **Rōjū Council (Senior Council)** — 5–7 councillors; sets national strategy, budgets, tariffs; can veto domain ordinances that conflict with national standards, navigation rules, or customs schedules.
- **Privy Liaison (Court–Bakufu)** — small office ensuring ceremonial harmony and legal form between imperial court and shogunate (prevents constitutional friction).

**OTL contrast:** In late Tokugawa Japan the Emperor was de jure sovereign and the shogunate governed, but there was no integrated **technical** state or national standards body. Here, the executive explicitly embeds such a body (see §2) before 1836.

**Consequences:** Coordinated national economic policy without abolishing the dual center; credible long‑horizon projects (canals, standards, early rail) and fewer jurisdictional dead ends.

## 2) Central technocratic bodies

- **Standards & Patent Office (SPO)** — quasi‑independent bureau created by edict (c. 1800–1805). Mandates metrology, machine and boiler standards, inspection of mines and mills, registration/enforcement of patents/privileges (10–15 years), and dissemination of technical digests. Maintains a traveling **Inspection Corps** and an **Innovation Bounty Fund**.
- **Commercial Courts (Edo/Osaka/Nagasaki)** — specialized benches for contracts, patents, maritime and prize cases; publishes case digests; appellate review in Edo.
- **Treasury & Customhouses** — centralized tariff setting and navigation dues collection; audited to common standards developed with the SPO.

**OTL contrast:** OTL had scattered rangaku circles and ad hoc arsenals; here we have a **formalized technical state** pre‑Meiji.

**Consequences:** Safer engines, interoperable tooling, better creditworthiness for industrial ventures, and faster intra‑Japan diffusion of proven designs.

---

## 3) Regional order and domain autonomy

- **Domains (han)** retain internal administration, policing, and control over arsenals/mines.
- **Han Competition Framework:** periodic, state‑sanctioned prize “tournaments” (iron output, engine uptime, textile efficiency, rail mileage) with tax rebates, supply contracts, and patent bounties for winners.
- **Governor’s Compacts (bakufu ↔ domains):** bilateral agreements: domains accept SPO inspections, national tariff schedules, and navigation rules; in return receive charters for manufactories, steam yards, and pilot rail concessions.

**OTL contrast:** Domain rivalry existed but was informal; here it is **institutionalized** and coupled to national standards.

**Consequences:** Innovation spreads across multiple centers; centralization proceeds through standards and procurement instead of civil conflict.

---

## 4) Urban corporations and consultative voice

- **Merchant Syndicates (Osaka, Nagasaki, Edo):** licensed corporate guilds with limited legal personhood; may hold mining leases, issue internal debentures, contract across domains, and bid on state orders.
- **Consultative Commercial Assembly (CCA):** annual forum of syndicates plus domain delegates; **advisory** on tariffs, port fees, and infrastructure priorities; minutes transmitted to the Rōjū and SPO.

**OTL contrast:** Merchant houses were powerful but lacked formal corporate status and a standing national forum.

**Consequences:** Deeper capital pools; smoother cross‑domain contracting; earlier proto‑zaibatsu behavior; oligarchic entrenchment.

---

## 5) Security forces and coastal control

- **Professional Army:** salaried, drilled samurai; arsenals standardized to SPO specs.
- **Coastal Steam Guard:** centralized flotilla patrolling Ezo/Kurils/Ryūkyū routes; prize courts tied to Commercial Courts.
- **Dedicated Police:** urban forces distinct from the army; factory inspectors embedded; censorship enforcement.

**OTL contrast:** No national steam patrols pre‑1850s in OTL; here they exist from the 1810s onward.

**Consequences:** Reduced piracy/smuggling, credible customs enforcement, and fewer coercive foreign incidents (no “Black Ships” moment).

---

## 6) Education, religion, and information order

- **Education:** expanded terakoya and domain academies with math/mechanics tracks; SPO accreditation for technical curricula; Dutch lecturers permitted under license; missionary activity restricted.
- **Religion:** regulated **State Religion** (Buddhist–Shintō complex) integrated into registry/welfare; kept out of policy.
- **Information:** licensed presses; scientific import prioritized; political agitation constrained; censorship board under the Shogunate.

**OTL contrast:** Mass schooling scaled post‑Meiji; here **technical** education advances earlier but remains elite‑skewed and decentralized.

**Consequences:** High artisan/technician literacy; slower diffusion of rights‑based political ideas.

---

## 7) Policy defaults (qualitative)

- **Monarchy + Oligarchy:** Emperor as sovereign; shogunate governs with domains and merchant syndicates; no mass suffrage.
- **Censorship + Secret Police:** technical print allowed; political mobilization restricted.
- **Interventionism + Mercantilism:** active standards, procurement, and selective protection; competitive markets otherwise.
- **Appointed Bureaucrats & Regulatory Bodies:** technocratic corps (SPO, Treasury, Navy, Courts); inspections in factories, mines, and docks.
- **Private Schools; Poor Laws; Charitable Health:** light social policy via civic and temple networks.

## 8) Territorial and foreign posture (1836)

- **Hokkaidō (Ezo):** full de facto shogunal control; Ainu retains homeland status administratively (not political autonomy).
- **Southern Kurils (Kunashir/Iturup):** routine garrisons and posts; legal delimitation with Russia pending.
- **Sakhalin (Karafuto):** seasonal posts and claims; ambiguity persists.
- **Ryūkyū:** de facto integration; tribute fiction maintained toward Qing.
- **External relations:** controlled openness via Dejima; Dutch are privileged technical intermediaries; Britain/US interact commercially, not coercively; **no unequal treaties**.

**Consequences:** Tariff autonomy intact; stronger fiscal base; slower influx of Western political societies.

---

## 9) Social order and tensions

- **Beneficiaries:** domain technical cadres, merchant houses, skilled artisans/engineers, samurai reappointed as managers/inspectors.
- **Pressures:** peasant unrest from commercialization; displacement of artisans by frames/engines; Ainu dispossession; conservative court resistance to merchant clout.
- **Release valves:** domain prizes, technical schooling, state procurement smoothing demand cycles, and limited property‑rights reforms (e.g., women’s property in merchant strata).

---

## 10) Differences from OTL (at a glance)

- **No unequal treaties (pre‑1860s)** → tariff sovereignty and legal jurisdiction retained.  
- **Early technical state (SPO)** → interoperable tooling, safer engines, consistent metrology.  
- **Oligarchic corporatism** (shogunate + domains + merchants) → high stability, slower mass politics.  
- **Military‑first steam** → secure coasts and credible customs enforcement.  
- **Earlier coastal frontier integration** (Ezo/Kurils) without large overseas conquests.

---

## 11) Plausible near‑term trajectory (1840–1860)

- **Internal:** gradual expansion of rail beyond pilots; consolidation of merchant syndicates; early national mint/standards codex revisions.  
- **External:** negotiated commercial conventions with Britain/US (no humiliation clauses); earlier Qing/Joseon technical spillovers through supervised channels.  
- **Political:** incremental centralization through standards/procurement, not abolition of domains; continued censorship with narrow professional spaces for technical debate.
