## Territorial extent (state/claim posture, 1836)
- **STATE_HOKKAIDO** — Owned by **JAP** (full de facto shogunal control). *Ainu remains a homeland culture in this state.*
- **Southern Kurils** — Represent via provinces within **STATE_SAKHALIN**/**Kurils subregions** (Kunashir, Iturup): **JAP** has routine posts/garrisons. At minimum, **JAP claims** on **STATE_SAKHALIN**; optionally grant ownership of the southern Kuril provinces if you want the assertive variant.
- **STATE_RYUKYU_ISLANDS** — Owned by **JAP** (de facto integration; tribute fiction toward Qing persists).
- **Sakhalin (Karafuto)** — **Claims** only; seasonal posts; leave northern control unsettled.
- **Ogasawara/Bonin** — If modeled, small **JAP** settler outpost/way-station tied administratively to a nearby Japanese state.

## Diplomatic posture (summary)
- Controlled openness via Dejima; no “Black Ships” crisis. No Korea/Taiwan/Manchuria at start.
