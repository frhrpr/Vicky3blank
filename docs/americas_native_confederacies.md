# Native Polities of the Americas (Canon, 1836)

> Scope: Defines the interior of North America for the “Early Industrial Japan, Atlantic Stall” timeline with **Option B (Truncated USA)**. This file is canonical; use it to guide tags, events, and diplomacy.

## Overview (theme & constraints)
- **Theme:** The continental interior is governed by **recognized Native confederacies**; coastal Europeans are shallow and treaty-bound; the **Atlantic Confederation** (small USA) is boxed in east of the Appalachians.
- **Constraints:** No miracle demographics. Epidemics occurred; power arises from **diplomatic recognition, control of river portages/customs**, horse economies (Plains), and coherent councils.

## Map sketch, 1836
- **Atlantic Confederation:** New England–Mid-Atlantic coastal strip; accepts an **Appalachian Line**.
- **New France:** St. Lawrence–Great Lakes corridor.
- **Spanish Louisiana & Florida:** Crown-governed river/gulf coasts.
- **Interior confederacies (recognized by Bourbon powers and the Atlantic Confederation):**
  1) **Great Lakes–Ohio Compact** — Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) + Shawnee coalition; controls Lakes portages (Niagara–Detroit–Chicago) and Ohio tributaries.
  2) **Southeast Compact** — Cherokee–Creek (Muscogee) council; holds upland Georgia/Alabama–Tennessee valleys; treaty courts at key crossings.
  3) **Comancheria** — Comanche-led horse polity; dominates Southern Plains trade (Taos–San Antonio–Arkansas).
  4) **Seven Council Fires** (Oceti Sakowin, Dakota/Lakota/Nakota) — Upper Missouri–Plains alliance; controls Missouri ferries and northern bison ranges.

> Optional adjuncts for later DLC/expansion: **Caddo/Osage corridor**, **Navajo (Diné)** in Four Corners, **Pueblos** with protected irrigation commons.

## 1700–1836 timeline (short)
- **1701–1740:** Haudenosaunee neutrality with Bourbon France holds; Cherokee/Creek formalize bilingual diplomacy.  
- **1740s–1760s:** Seven Years’ War analogue ends with **Bourbon advantage**; de facto **Appalachian Boundary** emerges; New France endures.  
- **1770s–1790s:** **Atlantic Confederation** forms as a coastal polity; recognizes the **Appalachian Line** under Bourbon pressure. **Tecumseh-era** organizing starts earlier in the Ohio Valley.  
- **1800s–1815:** **Great Lakes–Ohio Compact** formalized; **Southeast Compact** codifies councils and militia standards; **Comancheria** consolidates raiding/trade dominance.  
- **1815–1836:** Treaties fix Native customs points at river crossings; **non-cession clauses** require supermajorities; Bourbon guarantees keep borders from sliding.

## Institutions & economy (what makes them work)
- **Customs sovereignty:** Tolls at portages/fords (e.g., Sandusky, Kaskaskia, Muscle Shoals) fund councils.  
- **Mixed economies:** Subsistence + horse/bison + iron tools/firearms trade; artisan blacksmithing and textiles in nodes.  
- **Councils & courts:** Confederacy councils adjudicate disputes with treaty courts; Europeans/Atlantic Confederation accept jurisdiction inland.  
- **Defense:** Fortified towns (woodlands), river denial (canoe flotillas), and **light cavalry** (Plains) → high cost for invaders.

## Diplomacy (1836 defaults)
- **Bourbon powers (France/Spain):** Recognize borders and customs; exchange trade missions; no settlement charters inland.  
- **Atlantic Confederation:** Commercial treaties; barred from Mississippi; pays duties at the Appalachian gateways.  
- **Japan/Asia:** Minimal direct contact in 1836; rare port-to-port exchanges via Manila/Havana intermediaries; **no unequal treaties** anywhere in the Americas.

## Differences from OTL (one glance)
- No Louisiana Purchase; no Indian Removal; no trans-Appalachian settler flood; interior is **confederacy-governed** and cash-flowed by customs.

## Hooks for Vic3 (non-binding)
- **Tags:** Create 3–4 confederacy tags with oligarchic councils; communal land laws; river customs building.  
- **State traits:** “River Customs Point” (+tax capacity, +trade routes, −colonization acceptance).  
- **Events/JEs:** “Appalachian Line,” “Kaskaskia Customs,” “Taos Trade Fair,” “Non-Cession Clause Vote.”
