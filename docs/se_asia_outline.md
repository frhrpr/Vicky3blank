# Southeast Asia Outline — 1700→1836 (Asia Ascendant, Europe Slower)

**Theme:** Asia’s centers set the tempo; European coercion is late and thin. Power grows from **river basins, ports, and convoy networks**, not European chartered monopolies.

**Design Goal (1836):** A crowded, non-OTL map with **5–7 mid-powers** and several spoilers. Outcomes hinge on **basin logistics, court politics, and convoy control** rather than European intervention.

## 1) Timeline Since POD (highlights vs OTL)

### 1700–1730
- **No VOC-scale monopoly:** Dutch/Euro capital is thinner; Malay, Bugis, and Chinese kongsi houses fill the trade layer.  
  *OTL diff:* no singular Dutch customs wall. *Consequence:* local courts keep minting and dockyard skills.
- **Siam retools early:** Tin/teak finance river works; weights/ledgers improve via Japanese-linked traders.  
  *Consequence:* Bangkok can coordinate the Chao Phraya two decades earlier than OTL.

### 1730–1760
- **Makassar & Bugis resurgence:** Makassar acts as neutral convoy broker; Bugis settlements seed micro-thalassocracies along Sumatra/Borneo coasts.  
  *Consequence:* maritime polycentricity resists any single hegemon.
- **Konbaung Burma centralizes the Irrawaddy delta** but supply lines stall in the hills.  
  *Consequence:* chronic court–delta friction.

### 1760–1790
- **Vietnam bifurcates durably:** Gia Định (Saigon/Cochinchina) forms a maritime dockyard regime; Huế retains ritual land-tax authority.  
  *OTL diff:* split lasts longer. *Consequence:* “Two Vietnams” inertia by 1836.
- **Straits go polycentric:** Johor–Riau–Malacca align as a **Straits League** with Chinese merchant houses; **Aceh** holds the north pepper/pilgrim gate.  
  *Consequence:* overlapping tariffs, no colonial customs wall.

### 1790–1815
- **Lan Na & Lao oscillate** between Bangkok and Ava via marriage/hostage politics.  
  *Consequence:* long memory of conditional autonomy.
- **Sulu & Maguindanao reassert maritime reach:** Manila stays a Chinese-mestizo charter port; Iberian administration is shallow.  
  *OTL diff:* no durable Spanish net. *Consequence:* commercially linked, politically plural archipelago.

### 1815–1836
- **Siam = basin power, not conqueror:** Annexes parts of northwest Cambodia (Battambang/Sisophon); shares lower Mekong influence with Cochinchina.  
  *Consequence:* **Lower Mekong Condominium** (joint toll boards; fuzzy sovereignty).
- **Two Vietnams crystallize:** Dai Nam (Huế/Annam/Tonkin) vs **Gia Định Maritime State** (Saigon/Cochinchina).  
- **Burma stretched:** Irrawaddy heartland intact; **Mon delta councils** hold port finances at arm’s length; **Shan** chiefs keep exemptions.
- **Straits mosaic:** **Straits League** rivals **Aceh** and **Makassar** for convoy/pilgrim traffic; **West Borneo Kongsi Federation** manages tin/gold with Dayak compacts; **Brunei** sustains north-coast authority via marriage alliances.

## 2) 1836 Start Setup (countries & vibes)

### Mainland basin powers
- **Siam (Bangkok)** — Basin logistics leader; annexed NW Cambodia enclaves; claims over Laos/Isan; pragmatic court.  
  *Laws flavor:* oligarchy, appointed bureaucrats, interventionism.
- **Dai Nam (Huế/Annam/Tonkin)** — Ritual land-tax state; conservative exam culture; river toll instincts.  
  *Flavor:* autocracy, hereditary bureaucrats, land-based taxation; censorship.
- **Gia Định Maritime State (Saigon/Cochinchina)** — Dockyards, Chinese guild finance, Khmer frontier clients.  
  *Flavor:* oligarchy, appointed bureaucrats, interventionism/mercantilism; trade-center bonuses.
- **Konbaung Burma (Ava)** — Powerful center; **Mon Delta Councils** semi-autonomous; **Shan** exemptions in hills.  
  *Flavor:* autocracy; peasant levies; naval timber potential.
- **Lan Na (Chiang Mai)** — Vassal-leaning buffer with leveraged autonomy; toggles between Siam/Burma.  
  *Flavor:* oligarchy; traditionalism; low schools; mountain logistics perks.
- **Lao muang (Luang Prabang / Vientiane)** — Fragmented but resilient; tributary diplomacy; corridor stakes into Cambodia.

### Maritime poles & spoilers
- **Straits League (Johor–Riau–Malacca)** — Malay rulers + Chinese houses; bonded warehouses; convoy brokers.  
  *Flavor:* oligarchy; mercantilism; strong trade centers; limited heavy industry.
- **Aceh (n. Sumatra)** — Pepper/pilgrim gate; naval raiding tradition; rivalry with Straits League.  
  *Flavor:* oligarchy; isolationism/mercantilism toggle; port throughput buffs.
- **Makassar (Gowa)** — Bugis thalassocracy; east-Indonesia convoy hub; shipwright culture.  
  *Flavor:* oligarchy; maritime military focus.
- **West Borneo Kongsi Federation** — Mining kongsis + Dayak accords; fractious but rich.  
  *Flavor:* oligarchy; interventionism; mining throughput, unrest risk.
- **Brunei (north Borneo)** — Court alliances hold coast; hinterland bargains with upland groups.
- **Sulu Sultanate** — Sulu Sea tolls; Maguindanao counterpart on Cotabato; Manila charter port remains semi-autonomous.

> **Balance note:** At least **five separate markets** at start (Siam; Burma; Dai Nam; Gia Định; Straits/Aceh/Makassar split), plus several tributary/guarantee ties. Keep coastal and basin economies **disentangled** early.

## 3) Flashpoints & arcs (1836–1855)

- **Lower Mekong Condominium:** Siam + Gia Định manage toll boards; if either clamps tariffs or censors guild presses → Khmer princes switch patron; war scare.  
- **Irrawaddy Board Wars:** Failure to pay garrisons / accept Mon port autonomy → delta walkout; Shan exemption crisis escalates.  
- **Two Vietnams:** Huế can concede appointed bureaucrats + schools to cool Saigon; or double down on land tax/censorship and risk permanent split.  
- **Straits Triangle:** Straits League tries to harmonize light tariffs; Aceh/Makassar poach convoys or pilgrims; Borneo kongsis toggle buyers (Siam/Vietnam).  
- **Philippine Plurality:** Sulu toll hikes or Manila press freedom rows flip alignments among Visayan/Cordillera polities.

## 4) Implementation Notes (vanilla-safe levers)

- Use only vanilla laws/institutions and standard modifiers (trade center throughput, port levels, state infrastructure, schools/police levels).  
- Prefer **guarantees/defensive pacts/subjects** over early custom unions. Markets start **separate** to prevent snowball.  
- Journal arcs:  
  - **“Mekong Boards”** (Siam ↔ Gia Định): numeric goals on canal PMs/market access/Schools parity.  
  - **“Delta Charters”** (Burma): pay arrears, accept Mon port autonomy, or face delta autonomy.  
  - **“Two Courts”** (Vietnam): Huế reforms vs Saigon secession hardening.  
  - **“Straits Convoys”**: lighthouse/canal milestones unlock convoy bonuses; mismanaging tariffs triggers Aceh/Makassar counter-leagues.
