# India Outline — The Hindavi Commonwealth (Austrian-style Empire)

**Theme:** Asia leads; Europe slower. India is **not** a tariff-union story: it’s a **dynastic, multilingual empire** where **nationalities vie for rights and exits**. Think Habsburg logic, not China.

**Design Goal (1836):** A **tri-crown** imperial frame with powerful provinces. Stability depends on budgets, succession, and language parity—**not** on market absorption.

---

## 1) Constitutional Frame (post-POD evolution)

- **Tri-Crown Legitimacy:**  
  - **Padishah in Delhi** (Mughal mantle; court ritual & prestige),  
  - **Peshwa/Chhatrapati in Pune** (Maratha force & revenue),  
  - **Nawab-Governor in Calcutta** (Bengal finance & maritime credit).  
  These crowns recognized each other after a 18th-century settlement to avoid endless siege cycles.

- **Imperial Organs:**  
  - **Imperial Diwan (Finance Council):** sets land-tax scales, canal budgets, army payroll; seats weighted by **revenue share**.  
  - **Imperial Sabhā / Diet:** provincial estates by **language blocks** (Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Gujarati, Hindi belt, Rajasthani, Oriya, Sindhi/Kutchi, Kashmiri, Assamese).  
  - **Inspectorate-General:** audits canal & arsenal boards; can impound provincial payrolls in emergencies.

- **Army Constitution:** Provincial contingents under crown commanders; **doctrinally messy** (levies + a few professional cores). Promotions sensitive to language quotas.

**OTL differences & consequences**
- No Company Raj; wars are **inter-Indian**.  
- Publics form around **language print & canal works**; national awakenings arrive via budgets, not ideology.  
- Crises hit via **budget stalls, succession disputes, and canal sovereignty**, not customs tariffs.

## 2) 1836 Start Setup (entities & alignments)

### Imperial crowns (personal-union frame)
- **Delhi Regency (Mughal title)** — ritual center; weak direct revenue; high prestige.  
- **Pune (Maratha)** — mobile revenue engine; strong say in army musters.  
- **Calcutta (Bengal)** — finance hub; controls note issue & maritime insurance.

> The three are bound by **personal union & charters** (not a single state). Breaking the union is possible through crises below.

### Powerful provinces / nationalities (sample set)
- **Punjab (Khalsa Commonwealth)** — canal boards, grain/forge base, small professional corps; demands canal sovereignty.  
- **Awadh (Lucknow)** — grain reserves & court culture; wants budget guarantees and press leniency.  
- **Rajputana Estates** — cavalry levy rights; wary of central payroll discipline.  
- **Gujarat/Kathiawar** — merchant immunities (Surat/Bhavnagar); demand note convertibility.  
- **Mysore** — arsenal legacy; technocratic court; can align with Pune or Calcutta.  
- **Hyderabad** — cash-rich jagirs; claims precedence over Deccan deployments.  
- **Travancore** — coastal spice/education exception; missionary schooling without foreign sovereignty.  
- **Nagpur/Berar** — swing industrial grain/iron corridor.  
- **Assam** — tea/river pilotage; autonomy over Brahmaputra tolls.  
- **Sindh** — Indus pilotage; Karachi/Kutch trade intermediaries.

> Keep **separate markets** for major poles (Bengal, Maratha Deccan, Punjab) at start if you need a hard anti-snowball; otherwise maintain union via diplomacy, not customs.

---

## 3) Laws & Institutions (flavor, vanilla-safe)

- **Crowns:** monarchy/autocracy; **appointed or hereditary bureaucrats** vary by crown; **land-based taxation** common; censorship toggles by province.  
- **Provinces:** mix of oligarchy/appointed bureaucrats; some run **private schools** (Bengal, Travancore, Mysore).  
- **Institutions:** Some schools in coastal/educated polities (Bengal/Travancore/Mysore), low/none elsewhere.  
- **Army:** many on **peasant levies**; select provinces keep **professional cores** (Punjab/Mysore/Bengal).

---

## 4) Crisis & Reform Arcs (distinct from China)

> All arcs are **budget/rights/succession** levers—**not** customs unions.

- **Budget Reconciliation (annual Imperial Diwan) — JE**
  - *Pass:* pay stipends, canals, and army; +legitimacy.  
  - *Fail:* the largest unpaid province gains a **Right of Refusal** (pause remittances); two consecutive failures → **Secession Vote**.

- **Calcutta Note Panic**
  - Trigger: minting shortfall or trade shock; Bengal demands tariff autonomy & press rights.  
  - Outcomes: grant **Note Convertibility Act** (Bengal gains finance power, union legitimacy +) **or** refuse (Bengal prepares exit).

- **Punjab Canal Compromise**
  - Trigger: Delhi/Pune insist on canal appropriation; Punjab’s canal boards strike.  
  - Outcomes: accept **Canal Sovereignty** (Punjab stays, canal throughput +) **or** face **Khalsa Secession**.

- **Tamil–Telugu Parity Motion**
  - Trigger: officer quotas & budget shares; South blocks Diwan until parity granted.  
  - Outcomes: **Language Quotas Act** (officer corps diversified; morale +, bureaucracy cost +) **or** southern **tax strike** → crisis.

- **Lucknow Grain Reserve**
  - Trigger: monsoon failure; Awadh insists on reserve control and press leniency.  
  - Outcomes: devolve reserve (stability +) **or** seize grain (Awadh revolt risk & union legitimacy −).

- **Succession Dispute**
  - Trigger: death or deposition in any crown; two other crowns must ratify a candidate.  
  - Outcomes: unity candidate (legitimacy +) **or** split candidate (personal union fractures; provinces choose allegiance).

---

## 5) Player/Faction Paths (choose one)

- **Keep the Commonwealth:** pass budgets, share offices by language, compromise on canals/notes, maintain personal union.  
- **Lead a National Exit:** as Bengal (finance-first), Punjab (canal-first), Mysore (arsenal-first), or Awadh (grain-first); secure allies, survive the succession crisis.  
- **Imperial Centrism (late-game):** after multiple crises, propose a **Constitution of Crowns** (single imperial parliament) — only viable if legitimacy and provincial approval are high.

---

## 6) Balance & Tuning

- **Early constraints:** low Home Affairs, mixed literacy, levy-heavy armies.  
- **No early customs blob:** keep markets **separate or partially linked**; union cohesion comes from **budgets & legitimacy**, not tariffs.  
- **War costers:** winning wars without solving **budget/legitimacy** increases radicals and interest costs (scripted malus).

---

## 7) Implementation Notes (vanilla-safe)

- Use existing Indian country entries where possible (Punjab, Mysore, Hyderabad, Travancore, Bengal, Sindh, etc.); avoid new laws—stick to vanilla.  
- Create **personal-union relationships** among Delhi/Pune/Calcutta crowns; provinces start **autonomous** with obligations/guarantees.  
- Add journals/events listed above; use only standard modifier keys (tax capacity, institution levels, port/infra, legitimacy, turmoil).
