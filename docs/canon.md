# Alternative History Canon — Early Industrial Japan, Atlantic Stall

## General theme
- **Reversal of fortunes:** Japan dominates instead of Britain (more broadly: East Asia dominates instead of Europe/America), the historical losers become winners etc. This theme is the guiding light of this project — canon is malleable, but the theme should be present throughout.

## Pre-1700 foundations (set the stage)
- **Dutch Revolt fails (1568–1648):** No independent Dutch Republic or VOC-scale springboard; Antwerp remains Habsburg and pan-European clearing/bills culture develops more slowly.
- **Thirty Years’ War ends in a Catholic “guild concordat” (1620s–1648):** A Jesuit-influenced settlement re-empowers urban guild monopolies across much of the Empire/Northern Italy; large mechanized shops face legal drag.
- **Disasters reinforce conservatism:** Severe **North Sea floods** (1717/1720) consume Dutch capital in dike works; early **urban smoke/forest ordinances** discourage coal use near capitals. (Lisbon 1755 still happens and echoes regulation.)

## Points of departure (1688–1730)
**Japan (1688–1710):** The Tokugawa shogunate formalizes rangaku, incentivizes domain competition (Satsuma/Saga/Chōshū), opens Kyūshū coal to private consortia, and grants merchant corporate privileges. A central standards/patent office is planned to legitimize large workshops and unify measures and tooling.

**Europe/Atlantic (1701–1730):** A strengthened **Bourbon Family Compact** dominates Atlantic policing and cotton flows; a **1715 Jacobite restoration in Britain** weakens public finance and narrows patents; post-bubble **Guild Concordats** across major European states resist factory-scale shops; **forest/smoke ordinances** and **slow coke adoption** keep iron and engines expensive; the Americas never experience a **U.S. cotton surge** and **cotton gin diffusion stalls** (patent fights + embargoes). **Canal finance** underperforms after the bubbles, so energy/transport frictions persist.

## Japan’s industrial anchors
- **1730s–1750s:** Multi-spindle frames in silk/cotton; concentrated water-power workshops in Kansai.
- **1760s–1780s:** Atmospheric engines for mine drainage and furnace bellows; scaling iron foundries; standards/patent office active.
- **1790s–1810s:** Coastal steam craft; domain rail experiments; Osaka/Nagasaki become machine-tool hubs.

## World snapshot, 1836
**Japan:** A coherent early-industrial core (mechanized textiles, ironworks, atmospheric-engine drainage, coastal steam, pilot rail). Polity remains shogunal/monarchical with standardized administration. **Territory:** full de facto control of **Hokkaidō (Ezo)**; routine posts/garrisons on **Kunashir** and **Iturup** (southern Kurils); de facto integration of **Ryūkyū** (tribute fiction to Qing maintained); seasonal posts and ambiguity on **Sakhalin**; **no Korea/Taiwan/Manchuria**. **Diplomacy:** controlled openness via **Dejima**; **no “Black Ships” crisis**.

**Europe & the Americas:** **No factory system or railways.** Steam confined to pumps/curios; **raw cotton scarce/expensive**; **coke smelting and canals** remain under-scaled; **guilds strong**, **credit shallow**, **patents narrow**. Britain/US lack leverage in Japan and pivot to China/SE Asia.

**Qing China:** Earlier technical awareness via Nagasaki–Jiangnan literati channels. Select coastal/provincial administrations adopt **“useful devices” privileges** (tax rebates for practical inventions); a few **arsenal-style workshops** and **mine-drainage pumps** appear along the Lower Yangtze/Tianjin corridors. Trade with Japan expands in measured, supervised ways.

**Joseon Korea:** Court-backed **Silhak craft academies** (math, surveying, metallurgy) spread with Tsushima mediation; better iron tools and water frames in pockets; coastal patrols standardize. Reforms are cautious but credible; comfortable trade with Japan.

**Russia (Far East):** Encounters capable Japanese steam patrols; pressure for earlier Kuril/Sakhalin delimitations; no major conflicts before 1836.

**Dutch/British/US:** Dutch retain privileged technical conduit via Dejima; Britain/US lack coercive leverage; contact is commercial rather than forcible.

## 1840–1860 trajectories (guidance, not binding)
- **Japan:** Gradual expansion beyond pilot rails; consolidation of merchant syndicates; SPO codex revisions; negotiated commercial conventions (no humiliation clauses).
- **Qing/Joseon:** Incremental diffusion via supervised channels (lectures, tool imports, arsenals); coastal defense studies mature.
- **Europe/Americas:** Periodic attempts to break the **Guild Concordats**; without cheap cotton/iron/finance, factory takeoff remains sporadic and late.
