# Alternative History Canon — Early Industrial Japan, Atlantic Stall

## Point(s) of departure
**Japan (1688–1710):** The Tokugawa shogunate formalizes rangaku, incentivizes technical competition among domains (Satsuma/Saga/Chōshū), opens Kyūshū coal to private consortia, and grants merchant corporate privileges. A central standards/patent office is planned to legitimize large workshops and unify measures and tooling.

**Europe/Atlantic (1701–1730):** A strengthened **Bourbon Family Compact** dominates Atlantic policing and cotton flows; a **1715 Jacobite restoration in Britain** weakens public finance and narrows patents; post-bubble **Guild Concordats** across major European states legally resist factory-scale shops; forest/smoke ordinances and slow coke adoption keep iron and engines expensive; the Americas never experience a U.S. cotton surge.

## Japan’s industrial anchors
- **1730s–1750s:** Multi-spindle frames in silk/cotton; concentrated waterpower workshops in Kansai.
- **1760s–1780s:** Atmospheric engines for mine drainage and furnace bellows; scaling iron foundries; standards/patent office active.
- **1790s–1810s:** Coastal steam craft; domain rail experiments; Osaka/Nagasaki become machine-tool hubs.

## World snapshot, 1836
**Japan:** A coherent early-industrial core (mechanized textiles, ironworks, coastal steam, pilot rail). Polity remains shogunal/monarchical with standardized administration. **Territory:** full de facto control of Hokkaidō (Ezo); routine posts/garrisons on Kunashir and Iturup (southern Kurils); de facto integration of Ryūkyū (tribute fiction to Qing maintained); seasonal posts and ambiguity on Sakhalin; no Korea/Taiwan/Manchuria. **Diplomacy:** controlled openness via Dejima; no “Black Ships” crisis.

**Europe & the Americas:** No factory system or railways; steam confined to mines/curios; raw cotton scarce/expensive; guilds strong; credit shallow. Britain/US lack leverage in Japan and pivot to China/SE Asia.

**Qing China:** Earlier technical awareness via Nagasaki–Jiangnan literati channels; coastal defense study circles exist; trade with Japan expands in measured, supervised ways.

**Joseon Korea:** Modest proto-industrial scaling (iron tools, water frames); Tsushima mediation intensifies; coastal patrols standardize; reforms are cautious but more credible.

**Russia (Far East):** Encounters capable Japanese steam patrols; pressure for earlier Kuril/Sakhalin delimitations; no major conflicts before 1836.

**Dutch/British/US:** Dutch retain privileged technical conduit via Dejima; Britain/US lack coercive leverage; contact is commercial rather than forcible.
