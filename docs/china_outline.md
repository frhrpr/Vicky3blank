# China Outline — “Coastal Leagues + Sichuan Independent” (1836)

**Canon fit:** Asia ascendant without Western coercion; Japan as early disciplined industrializer; China modernizes **provincially** via licensed innovation and chartered ports.  
**Design goal:** Make China **big but sticky**—rich coastal engines outside the Court’s direct control; the interior lags and can **fragment** unless the player manages finance, logistics, and legitimacy. Political reconquest is optional; **a Zollverein-style customs union** is the primary re‑integration path.

---

## 1) Start Setup (1836)

### Overlord
- **Qing Empire (CHI)** — unified interior **except** Sichuan; large population, prestige, and army, but **weak institutions**, **leaky finance**, **inland infrastructure gaps**.

### Independent polities (separate markets)
- **Sichuan (SIH)** — *independent* inland basin power; conservative administration, small professional core; river corridor focus.
- **Yue / Canton Cohong Free Port (YUE)** — *independent* coastal commercial state centered on Guangzhou; trade‑first.
- **Jiangnan Chartered League (JNL)** — *custom tag*, compact city‑region league (Shanghai–Ningbo–Hangzhou / Jiangsu + North & South Anhui); interventionist, literate, light industry + finance.

### Inside Qing but “near‑break” (Tier 2)
- **Guangxi (GNG)**, **Hunan (HNA)**, **Guizhou (GUI)**, **Shandong (SHA)**, **Zhili/Beiyang (ZHI/BEI)** — start loyal but each has a **regional stress** package that can escalate to autonomy/independence if mismanaged.

### Frontier latent (Tier 3)
- **Manchuria (MCH), Xibei (XIB), Tibet (TIB), Mongolia (MGL), Xinjiang (XIN)** — diplomatic exits or late crises if centralization is pushed too hard too fast.

---

## 2) Diplomacy — **Power Bloc A** at Start

**Bloc leader:** **Qing (CHI)**  

**Members in the China bloc from day one:** **Tibet (TIB), Mongolia (MGL), Xinjiang (XIN)**.  
- Rationale: ritual/suzerain ties + garrison logistics; stabilizes the steppe/frontier so early crises occur **inside** China proper.
- Implementation: these can remain **subjects** (e.g., Tributary/Protectorate) *and* be members of the power bloc. Sharing CHI’s market here is acceptable—frontier economies are small.

**Outside the bloc (independent, separate markets):** **JNL** and **YUE**.  
- Rationale: chartered coastal polities guard autonomy; they bargain rather than bandwagon. Preserves price fragmentation and prevents early snowballing.

**Sichuan (SIH):** **Neutral** (non‑aligned) at start.  
- Bilateral ties: **Trade Agreement** and a **Defensive Pact** can be unlocked via events once CHI proves competent (see Cohesion thresholds below).

**AI nudges:** JNL/YUE/SIH have **low desire** to join the China bloc until **Cohesion ≥ 70 for 24 months** *and* CHI has funded **standards/canal** promises (Customs Convention chain).

---

## 3) Markets & the Zollverein Path

- **Separate markets at game start:** CHI interior, **SIH**, **YUE**, **JNL**.  
- Qing’s **primary non‑military win**: build a **Qing‑led customs union** (“**Customs Convention**”) that gradually brings these markets into **one market** without political annexation.  
- Union is **conditional**: standardized weights & bonded transit, canal/river upkeep, tariff floor guarantees, and local school parity in member regions.

---

## 4) Laws & Institutions (start flavor)

### Qing (CHI)
- **Government:** Monarchy/Autocracy; **Hereditary Bureaucrats**; **Censorship**; **State Religion**.
- **Economy:** **Land‑Based Taxation**; **Interventionism**; **Peasant Levies**; **Canton System**.  
- **Country maluses (static modifiers):**  
  - *Court Procurement:* **−15–25%** construction efficiency; **+ construction goods cost**.  
  - *Protocol Administration:* **− institution growth speed**, **+ institution cost**.  
  - *Silted Canals:* inland states **− Infrastructure**, slightly worse **market‑access price impact**.

### Sichuan (SIH)
- **Government:** Autocracy/Oligarchy; **Appointed Bureaucrats**; **Tenant Farmers**.  
- **Economy:** **Interventionism**; small professional army; **river transport/canal investment** incentives.  
- **Start kit:** Grain/tea/copper, a couple **Construction Sectors**, early **Arsenals** (low level), modest **Universities**.

### Jiangnan Chartered League (JNL, custom)
- **Government:** **Oligarchy**, **Appointed Bureaucrats**, **Private Schools**.  
- **Economy:** **Interventionism + Mercantilism**; **Trade Center** and **Finance** emphasis.  
- **Start kit:** Tools/Textiles/Shipyards (low–mid); **2–3 Universities**; **+ Innovation** (*Licensed Academies*); strong **Trade Centers**.

### Yue / Canton Cohong (YUE)
- **Government:** **Oligarchy**, **Appointed Bureaucrats**, **Canton System** (local), **Private Schools** (modest).  
- **Economy:** Trade throughput bonuses; **− heavy‑industry throughput** outside Textiles/Tools to keep it commercial‑led.  
- **Start kit:** Big **Trade Center**, good **Ports**, **Textiles/Tools 1–2**.

---

## 5) Tiered Fragmentation (what can break, why)

### Tier 1 (already out): **SIH, YUE, JNL**
- Prevents one giant market; creates **triangular tension** (inland SIH vs. coastal JNL/YUE vs. CHI interior).

### Tier 2 (1836–1845 “near‑break” checks)
- **Guangxi (GNG):** Zhuang toll + Cohong rivalry; if inland market access < **85%** or Guangdong ports starve inland revenue → ultimatum.  
- **Hunan (HNA):** rice convoys & prefect graft; if grain routes < **90%** access or **Police < 2** → ultimatum.  
- **Guizhou (GUI):** highland tax arrears; if **tax capacity** < threshold and **turmoil** high → ultimatum.  
- **Shandong (SHA):** canal upkeep/salt gabelle arrears; if **minting** dips & **canal PMs** not upgraded → ultimatum.  
- **Zhili/Beiyang (ZHI/BEI):** banner stipends & Tianjin provisioning; if **government wages unpaid** or **legitimacy** drops → ultimatum.

### Tier 3 (1845+ or forced centralization)
- **MCH, XIB, TIB, MGL, XIN** trigger if the Court **rams centralization** (e.g., trying **Elected Bureaucrats/Per‑Capita Tax** too early) or **underpays garrisons**.

---

## 6) Player‑Driven System: **China’s Balance Sheet** (QNG Journal)

**Always‑visible** JE (1836–1855) that computes three scores monthly and a composite **Cohesion**:

- **FISCAL (0–100):** tax capacity coverage, debt service ratio, minting stability, gov’t wages paid.  
- **LOGISTICS (0–100):** avg interior **Market Access**, # states with **Infra deficit**, % of river/canal PMs upgraded, **Convoy headroom**.  
- **LEGITIMACY (0–100):** **Legitimacy**, average **Turmoil**, **Radicals per 100k**, IG approval balance (Landowners+Armed Forces vs. Industrialists+Intelligentsia).

> **Cohesion** = mean(FISCAL, LOGISTICS, LEGITIMACY). Stored as a scripted variable; updated via monthly `on_action`.

### Thresholds & Effects
- **Cohesion ≥ 70 for 24 months →** unlock **Customs Convention** invites (see §7).  
- **Cohesion < 40 for 12 months (or any subscore < 30) →** fire **one Regional Ultimatum** (see §8) in the most stressed region.  
- **Cohesion < 25 →** two ultimatums check each year (compounding risk).  
- **If 2+ regions break away** → temporary **− Construction efficiency** malus (*Court Procurement Crisis*) until Cohesion ≥ 60.

**How the player raises scores (skill expression)**
- **FISCAL:** expand Bureaucracy, keep wages paid, avoid usurious debt; delay costly tax reforms until stable.  
- **LOGISTICS:** build **roads/canals** on trunk corridors (Grand Canal, Yangtze), fix inland **Market Access**, maintain **convoys**; upgrade **ports**.  
- **LEGITIMACY:** don’t jam centralization early; meet a region’s demands; keep **Police 2**; use **relief** events after bad harvests.

---

## 7) **Customs Convention** (Zollverein Path)

When unlocked, **invite** SIH, YUE, JNL, and Tier‑2 minors to **join Qing’s market** via event/AI acceptance boosts if you promise and deliver:

- **Standards & Bonds:** fund **weights/measure** unification and **bonded transit** (pay canal/river projects in specified states).  
- **Tariff Floor:** commit to **Mercantilism or above** for X years (no Free Trade lurch).  
- **Autonomy Guarantees:** don’t attempt centralization laws for X years.  
- **Education Parity:** **Schools ≥ 2** in member regions within 2 years.

**On success:** target country joins your **Customs Union**, you gain **trade throughput** and **infra** bonuses along agreed corridors. Breaking promises imposes **Legitimacy** and **Regional attitude** penalties and blocks re‑invites for 5 years.

---

## 8) **Regional Ultimatums** (Breakaway Path)

When thresholds fail, the **most stressed** region issues **numeric, achievable demands** (24‑month timer by default). Examples:

- **Hunan (HNA) Ultimatum**  
  *Demands:* Market Access ≥ **90%** in Hunan; **Police ≥ 2**; no **Elected Bureaucrats** for 5 yrs.  
  *Meet →* stays + local throughput buff; *Fail →* **independence** with small professional army + temporary *Militia Reform* buff.

- **Guangxi (GNG) Ultimatum**  
  *Demands:* Raise inland trade capacity; guarantee Cohong doesn’t lower Guangxi’s port allotments; **Police ≥ 2**.  
  *Fail →* **independence** (customs‑focused).

- **Shandong (SHA) Ultimatum**  
  *Demands:* Canal PM upgrades completed; settle **salt‑gabelle arrears** (pay event); maintain **gov’t wages**.  
  *Fail →* **independence**.

- **Zhili/Beiyang (ZHI/BEI) Ultimatum**  
  *Demands:* Pay **banner stipends**; keep **Land Tax**; avoid **Elected Bureaucracy** for now.  
  *Fail →* **Beiyang** autonomy/independence.

- **Guizhou (GUI) Ultimatum**  
  *Demands:* Raise **tax capacity**; reduce **turmoil**; **Police ≥ 2**.  
  *Fail →* **independence**.

---

## 9) Balance Targets (tuning guide)

- **1836 GDP:** CHI interior ≈ **75–85%** of vanilla CHI; **SIH+YUE+JNL** add **+15–25%** total but **outside** CHI market.  
- **Innovation:** CHI **−10%** vs vanilla (exam formalism); **JNL/YUE +10–15%**.  
- **Construction (effective):** CHI **−15–25%**; SIH/JNL/YUE **+10–20%** locally.  
- **Army:** CHI large but lower quality (Peasant Levies, supply malus inland); SIH small professional core; JNL/YUE tiny but well‑supplied.

---

## 10) AI & Storyteller Rules

- **Bloc membership:** only **TIB, MGL, XIN** begin in the **China power bloc**; **JNL/YUE** remain outside; **SIH** is neutral.  
- **AI desire:** JNL/YUE/SIH have low desire to join the bloc or CHI market until **Cohesion ≥ 70 (24m)** and **Customs Convention** promises are met.  
- **CHI AI priorities:** roads/canals on the Yangtze & Grand Canal corridor; keep **Police 2**; **pay wages**; avoid early centralization.  
- **Punish force‑centralization:** forcing centralization laws early increases the weight for **Tier‑2/Tier‑3** ultimatums.

---

## 11) Minimal Implementation Plan

1. **Country setup (data only)**  
   - Make **SIH** and **YUE** independent with their own markets; add **JNL** (custom tag) with compact Jiangnan footprint.  
   - Keep **TIB/MGL/XIN** as frontier subjects and **members of the China power bloc**.  
   - Set CHI interior laws/institutions/modifiers; seed buildings/PMs accordingly.

2. **Static modifiers** (`common/static_modifiers/*.txt`)  
   - *Court Procurement*, *Protocol Administration*, *Silted Canals*, *Licensed Academies*, etc., using vanilla modifier keys.

3. **Journal & events** (`common/journal_entries/*.txt`, `events/*.txt`)  
   - **JE: China’s Balance Sheet** — computes FISCAL/LOGISTICS/LEGITIMACY & Cohesion.  
   - **Chain: Customs Convention** — invitations + delivery checks.  
   - **Regional Ultimatum packs** — one per region (clear numeric goals; success/failure branches).

4. **Scripted variables/triggers/effects** (`common/scripted_*`)  
   - Variables for the three scores + cohesion; triggers to test thresholds; effects to apply modifiers/move countries into market.

5. **AI strategy tweaks** (`common/ai_strategies/*.txt`)  
   - Boost acceptance for Customs Union when JE promises are active and delivered; prefer infra/ports in specified corridors.
